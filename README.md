# R-scripts-for-16-S-rRNA-data-analysis


Root-associated microbial communities are important for maintaining agricultural productivity.  16 S rRNA exists in all the living organisms, by profiling it, we can surivive the changes of microbial communities in the different samples/tissues under different environmental conditions. This is to help us understand well "who" are there, and then hypothesis can be generated to further understand the functional difference and molecular mechanism.
